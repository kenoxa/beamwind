> This is a only a preset. [@beamwind/play](https://github.com/kenoxa/beamwind/blob/main/packages/play) provides a ready to use `bw` export.
> This preset should be used for _prototyping only_ as it usually prevents a consistent UI experience.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @beamwind/preset-play
```

## Usage

> Please refer to the [main documentation](https://beamwind.js.org#usage) for further information.

```js
import { setup, warn } from '@beamwind/core'
import play from '@beamwind/preset-play'

// Use warn as fallback if no conversion could be made
setup(play(warn))
```

See [preset-play/src/play.ts](https://github.com/kenoxa/beamwind/blob/main/packages/preset-play/src/play.ts) which conversions are applied.

Most tailwind classes use a deterministic number calculation scheme (for example [width](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/width)). If beamwind detects a number in a directive and there is not mapped value in the theme it uses the following algorithm to generate a CSS value which aligns with the tailwind rules for that directive:

- decimal numbers (`2` or `1.5`) are divided by a divisor and a unit is added (`w-2.5` becomes `width: 0.625rem;`)
- fractions (`1/6` or `3/5`) are evaluated and `%` is used as a unit (`w-4/5` becomes `width: 80%;`)

- most directives are lenient when a value is not found in the theme:

  - decimal numbers (`2` or `1.5`) are divided by a divisor and a unit is added (`w-2.5` becomes `width: 0.625rem;`)
  - fractions (`1/6` or `3/5`) are evaluated and `%` is added as a unit (`w-4/5` becomes `width: 80%;`)
  - color names (`text-rebeccapurple`) and hex colors (`text-#009900`)

- `bg-gradient` accepts additionally to the side-or-corner parameter (`bg-gradient-to-tr`) an angle or mixed parameters:
  - `bg-gradient` - defaults to `180deg` eg `to bottom`
  - `bg-gradient-45`
  - `bg-gradient-0.25turn`
  - `bg-gradient-to-bottom-left`
