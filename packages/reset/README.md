Built on top of [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/), @beamwind/reset is a set of base styles that are designed to smooth over cross-browser inconsistencies and make it easier for you to work within the constraints of your design system.

If you do **not** need to support IE 10/11, we recommend using [@beamwind/preflight](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@beamwind/preflight).
