Built on top of [modern-normalize](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize), @beamwind/preflight is designed for and tested on the latest stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari. Preflight does not support any version of IE, including IE 11.

If you need to support IE 11, we recommend using [@beamwind/reset](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@beamwind/reset).
